# 🎯 AI-Generated Streamlit App

> This application was automatically generated using AI technology.

## 📝 Description

Managing personal finances can be difficult when expenses, income, and savings are scattered across different sources. Many people struggle to understand where their money is going and how much they are actually saving each month. Spreadsheets can be time-consuming and confusing without visual insights.
The goal of this project is to build a Streamlit-based Personal Finance Dashboard that helps users track and understand their financial activity. The application will:
Allow users to upload a CSV file containing their expenses and income.
Automatically categorize transactions into groups like food, bills, shopping, travel, etc.
Display visual charts such as pie charts and bar charts to show spending patterns.
Include a savings goal tracker to help users monitor progress toward their financial goals.
This dashboard will make it easy for users to visualize their financial habits, manage expenses, and improve their monthly budgeting through a clean and interactive interface.
